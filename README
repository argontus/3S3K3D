== INSTALLING THE EXTERNAL LIBRARIES ON MINGW ==

=== IN SHORT ===

On MinGW, the easiest way to install the external libraries is to:

* Download http://student.labranet.jamk.fi/~e6299/mingw_package.zip
* Extract it to the repo root directory
* That's it


=== IN DETAIL ===

The MinGW Code::Blocks projects assume that the 'bin', 'include' and 'lib'
folders contain all files needed for using the external libraries. To build and
link the projects, you must:

* Add dynamically linked external library files under the 'bin' folder
* Add external library header file folders under the 'include' folder
* Add statically linked external library files under the 'lib' folder

The Code::Blocks project files needed for building the external libraries GLEW,
LIB3DS and LUA can be downloaded from:

http://student.labranet.jamk.fi/~e6299/

The prebuilt development libraries for SDL 1.2.14 can be downloaded from:

http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php

OpenGL comes with MinGW and should already be installed on your system.

After all external libraries have been successfully installed, the 'bin',
'include' and 'lib' folder structures should look like:

/bin
    lib3ds.dll
    libglew.dll
    liblua.dll
    SDL.dll
/include
    /glew
        glew.h
        glxew.h
        wglew.h
    /lib3ds
        lib3ds.h
    /lua
        luaxlib.h
        lua.h
        luaconf.h
        lualib.h
    /SDL
        <all .h files that came with SDL 1.2.14>
/lib
    lib3ds.dll.a
    libglew.dll.a
    liblua.dll.a
    libSDL.dll.a
